Probabilistic Time Series Models

# Completed
- HMM discrete observations forward-backward
- HMM continuous observations forward-backward
- HMM Baum-Welch algorithm for paramter estimation
- HMM Viterbi algorithm for most probable path
- LDS filtering and smoothing
- LDS EM parameter estimation

# In Progress
- LDS EM Cholesky decomposition for stable procedure
